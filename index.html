    <h4>Check JS console for the output from your code</h4>

    <!-- It's generally better to load your JS just b4 the end <body> 
        tag as U want the all the objects you might interact with in the DOM 
        to be setup first and available to muck with. 
        (this is an HTML comment BTW. Note start and end markers) -->
        
        <!-- Link to the external JS using the 'script' tags. -->
    <script src="./poe.js">
        // You have to have the end tag /script even though we don't 
        // put code directly in that block, but in the JS script block,
        // it still has to be valid JS and that includes comments like this 
    </script>
